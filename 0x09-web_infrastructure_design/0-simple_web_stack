Here is a simple web stack that can be used to host a website reachable via www.foobar.com:

Server: The server is the physical machine that hosts the website. It can be a dedicated server, a virtual private server (VPS), or a cloud server. In this case, we will use a dedicated server.
Web server: The web server is responsible for serving the website's static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also handles requests for dynamic content, such as PHP scripts. In this case, we will use Nginx, a popular and efficient web server.
Application server: The application server is responsible for running the website's code. This code can be written in a variety of languages, such as PHP, Python, or Java. In this case, we will use a simple PHP application.
Database: The database stores the website's data. This data can be anything from user accounts to product inventory. In this case, we will use MySQL, a popular and open-source database.
Domain name: The domain name is the address of the website on the internet. In this case, the domain name is www.foobar.com.
When a user wants to access the website, their computer will first contact the domain name server (DNS). The DNS will tell the computer the IP address of the server that hosts the website. The computer will then connect to the server and request the website's files. The web server will send the files to the computer, and the user will be able to view the website.

The following are some of the issues with this infrastructure:

Single point of failure: If the server fails, the website will be unavailable.
Downtime during maintenance: When the web server or application server needs to be updated, the website will be unavailable during the maintenance period.
Cannot scale: If the website receives too much traffic, the server may not be able to handle it and the website will become slow or unavailable.
Here are some ways to improve this infrastructure:

Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers. This will help to prevent the website from becoming slow or unavailable if one server fails.
Use a content delivery network (CDN) to cache static files closer to the users. This will improve the performance of the website for users who are located far away from the server.
Use a cloud computing platform to scale the website up or down as needed. This will help to ensure that the website is always available and performing well, regardless of the amount of traffic it receives.
